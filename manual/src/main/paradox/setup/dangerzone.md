## Commons settings

This part allows you to configure various things :

* `No Auth0 login` => allow you to disabled Auth0 login to the Otoroshi admin dashboard
* `API read only` => disable `writes` on the Otoroshi admin api
* `Use HTTP streaming` => use http streaming for each response. It should always be true
* `Use circuit breakers` => allow usage of circuit breakers for each service
* `Digitus medius` => change the character of endless HTTP responses from `0` to `üñï`
* `Limit concurrent requests` => allow you to specify a max number of concurrent requests on an Otoroshi instance to avoid overloading
* `Max concurrent requests` => max allowed number of concurrent requests on an Otoroshi instance to avoid overloading
* `Max HTTP/1.0 response size` => max size of an HTTP/1.0 responses, because they are memory mapped
* `Max local events` => number of events stored localy (alerts and audits)
* `lines` => at least one (`prod`). for other, it will allow you to declare urls like `service.line.domain.tld`. For prod it will be `service.domain.tld`

## Whitelist / blacklist settings

Otoroshi is capable of filtering request by ip address, allowing or blocking requests.

Otoroshi also provides a fun feature called `Endless HTTP responses`. If you put an ip address in that field, then, for any http request on Otoroshi, every response will be 128 GB of `0`.

@@@ note
Note that you may provide ip address with wildcard like the following `42.42.*.42` or `42.42.42.*` or `42.42.*.*`

## Global throttling settings

Otoroshi is capable of managing throttling at a global level. Here you can configure number of authorized requests per second on a single Otoroshi instance and the number of authorized request per second for a unique ip address.

## Analytics settings

One on the major features of Otoroshi is being able of generating internal events. Those events are not stored in Otoroshi's datastore but can be sent using `WebHooks`. You can configure those `WebHooks` from the `Danger Zone`.

Otoroshi is also capable of reading some analytics and displays it from another MAIF product called `Omo√Økane`. As Omoikane is not publicly available yet, is capable of storing events in an [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) cluster. For more information about analytics and what it does, just go to the @ref:[detailed chapter](../integrations/analytics.md)

## Kafka settings

One on the major features of Otoroshi is being able of generating internal events. These events are not stored in Otoroshi's datastore but can be sent using a [Kafka message broker](https://kafka.apache.org/). You can configure Kafka access from the `Danger Zone`.

By default, Otoroshi's alert events will be sent on `otoroshi-alerts` topic, Otoroshi's audit events will be sent on `otoroshi-audits` topic and  Otoroshi's traffic events will be sent on `otoroshi-analytics` topic.

Keystore and truststore paths are optional local path on the server hosting Otoroshi

## Alerts settings

Each time a dangerous action or something unusual is performed on Otoroshi, it will create an alert and store it. You can be notified for each of these alerts using `WebHooks` or emails. To do so, just add the `WebHook` URL and optional headers in the `Danger Zone` or any email address you want (you can add more than one email address).

## StatsD settings

Otoroshi is capable of sending internal metrics to a StatsD agent. Just put the host and port of you StatsD agent in the `Danger Zone` to collect these metrics. If you using [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), don't forget to check the dedicated button :)

## Auth0 settings

It is possible to configure Otoroshi to allow admin users to log in through Auth0. Otoroshi also provides a feature called `Private apps.` that allows you to force login to an Auth0 domain before accessing an app. You can create an Auth0 client (https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients) for each of those features (admin users login and private apps login) and customize it with any rule you want (don't forget allowed callbacks, like `http://otoroshi.foo.bar:8080/backoffice/auth0/callback` and `http://privateapps.foo.bar:8080/backoffice/auth0/callback`).

Once you're done, go to the settings of each client (https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/settings) to get the information needed for the `Danger Zone`.

## Mailgun settings

If you want to send emails for every alert generated by Otoroshi, you need to configure your Mailgun credentials in the `Danger Zone`. These parameters are provided in you Mailgun domain dashboard (i.e. https://app.mailgun.com/app/domains/my.domain.foo.bar) in the information section.

## CleverCloud settings

As we built our products to run on Clever-Cloud, Otoroshi has a close integration with Clever-Cloud. In this section of `Danger Zone` you can configure how to access Clever-Cloud API.

To generate the needed value, please refers to [Clever-Cloud documentation](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/clever-cloud-apis/cc-api/)

## Import / exports and panic mode

For more details about imports and exports, please go to the @ref:[dedicated chapter](../usage/8-importsexports.md)

About panic mode, it's an unusual feature that allows you to discard all current admin. sessions, allows only admin users with U2F devices to log back, and pass the API in read-only mode. Only a person who has access to Otoroshi's datastore will be able to turn it back on.
