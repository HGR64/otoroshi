* `No Auth0 login` => allow you to disabled Auth0 login to the Otoroshi admin dashboard
* `API read only` => disable `writes` on the Otoroshi admin api 
* `Use HTTP streaming` => use http streaming for each response. It should always be true
* `Use circuit breakers` => allow usage of circuit breakers for each service
* `Digitus medius` => change the character of endless HTTP responses from `0` to `üñï`
* `Limit concurrent requests` => allow you to specify a max number of concurrent requests on an Otoroshi instance to avoid overloading
* `Max concurrent requests` => max allowed number of concurrent requests on an Otoroshi instance to avoid overloading
* `Max HTTP/1.0 response size` => max size of an HTTP/1.0 responses, because they are memory mapped
* `Max local events` => number of events stored localy (alerts and audits)
* `lines` => at least one (`prod`). for other, it will allow you to declare urls like `service.line.domain.tld`. For prod it will be `service.domain.tld`

## Whitelist / blacklist settings

Otoroshi is capable of filtering request per ip address, allowing or blocking requests.

Otoroshi also provide a funny feature called `Endless HTTP responses`. If you put an ip address in that field, then, for any http request on Otoroshi, every response will be 128 GB of `0`.

## Global throttling settings

Otoroshi is capable of managing throttling at a global level. Here you can configure number of authorized request per second on a single Otoroshi instance and the number of authorized request per second for a unique ip address.

## Analytics settings

One on the major point of Otoroshi is to generate internal events. Those events are not stored in its datastore but can be sent using `WebHooks`. You can configure those `WebHooks` from the `Danger Zone`.

Also, Otoroshi is capable of reading some analytics and displays it from another MAIF product called `Omo√Økane`. As Omoikane is not publicly available yet, we provide a connector that stores events in an [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) cluster. You can provide the URL of this connector in the `Analytics source URL` setting (it looks like `http://omoikane.foo.bar:8080/api/v1/events`) but also use it as `WebHook` target in the `Analytics hook URL` (it looks like `http://omoikane.foo.bar:8080/api/v1/events`).

## Kafka settings

One on the major point of Otoroshi is to generate internal events. Those events are not stored in its datastore but can be sent using a [Kafka message broker](https://kafka.apache.org/). You can configure Kafka access from the `Danger Zone`.

By default Otoroshi's alert events will be sent on a `otoroshi-alerts` topic, Otoroshi's audit events will be sent on a `otoroshi-audits` topic and  Otoroshi's traffic events will be sent on a `otoroshi-analytics` topic.

Keystore and truststore path are optional local path on the server hosting Otoroshi

## Alerts settings

Each time a dangerous actions or something unusual is happening on Otoroshi, it will create an alert and store it. You can ne notified for each of those alerts using `WebHooks` or emails. To do so, just add the `WebHook` URL and optional headers in the `Danger Zone` or any email address you want (you can add more than one email address).

## StatsD settings

Otoroshi is capable of sending internal metrics to a StatsD agent. Just put the host and port of you StatsD agent in the `Danger Zone` to collect those metrics. If you using [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com), don't forget to check the dedicated button :)

## Auth0 settings 

It is possible to configure Otoroshi to allow admins to log in through auth0. Also, Otoroshi provides a feature called `Private apps.` that allow you to force login to an auth0 domain before accessing an app. You can create an Auth0 client (https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients) for each of those features (admins login and private apps. login) and customize it with any rule you want (don't forget allowed callbacks, like `http://otoroshi.foo.bar:8080/backoffice/auth0/callback` and `http://privateapps.foo.bar:8080/backoffice/auth0/callback`). 

Once it's done, go to the settings of each client (https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/settings) to get the informations needed for the `Danger Zone`.

## Mailgun settings

If you want to send email for every alert generated by Otoroshi, you need to configure your Mailgun credentials in the `Danger Zone`. Those informations are provided in you Mailgun domain dashboard (ie. https://app.mailgun.com/app/domains/my.domain.foo.bar) in the information section.

## CleverCloud settings

As we built our products to run on Clever-Cloud, Otoroshi has a close integration with Clever-Cloud. In this section of `Danger Zone` you can configure how to access Clever-Cloud API. 

To generate the needed value, please refers to [Clever-Cloud documentation](https://www.clever-cloud.com/doc/clever-cloud-apis/cc-api/)

## Import / exports and panic mode

for more details about imports / exports, please go to the @ref:[dedicated chapter](../usage/8-importsexports.md)

About panic mode, it's a unusual feature that allow you to discard all current admin. sessions, allow only admin. with U2F devices to log back, and pass the API in read only mode. Only a person with access to the Otoroshi datastore will be able to turn it back.
