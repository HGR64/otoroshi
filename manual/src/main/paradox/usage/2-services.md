# Managing services

Now let's create services. Services or `service descriptor` let you declare how to proxy a call from a domain name to another domain name (or multiple domain names). Let's say you have an API exposed on `http://192.168.0.42` and I want to expose it on `https://my.api.foo`. Otoroshi will proxy all calls to `https://my.api.foo` and forward them to `http://192.168.0.42`. While doing that, it will also log everyhting, control accesses, etc.

## Otoroshi entities

There are 3 major entities at the core of Otoroshi

* service groups
* **service descriptors**
* api keys

A `service descriptor` is contained in a `service group` and is allowed to be accessed by all the `api key`s authorized on the `service group`.

## Create a service descriptor

To create a `service descriptor`, click on `Add service` on the Otoroshi sidebar. Then you will be asked to choose a name for the service what is the group of the service. You also have two buttons to create a new group and assign it to the service and create a new group with a name based on the service name.

You will have a serie of toggle buttons to

* activate / deactivate a service
* display maintenance page for a service
* display contruction page for a service
* enforce secure exchange between services
* force https usage on the exposed service

Then, you will be able to choose the URL that will be used to reach your new service on Otoroshi.

In the `service targets` section, you will be able to choose where the call will be forwarded. You can use multiple targets, in that case, Otoroshi will perform a round robin load balancing between the targets.

You can also specify a target root, if you say that the target root is `/foo/`, then any call to `https://my.api.foo` will call `http://192.168.0.42/foo/` and nay call to `https://my.api.foo/bar` will call `http://192.168.0.42/foo/bar`.

In the URL patterns section, you will be able to choose, URL by URL which is private and which is public. By default, all services are private and each call must provide an `api key`. But sometimes, you need to access a service publicly. In that case, you can provide patterns (regex) to make some or all URL public (for example with the pattern `/.*`). You also have a `private pattern` field to restrict public patterns.

### Secure exchange

If you enable secure communication for a given service, you will have to add a filter on the target application that will take the `Otoroshi-State` header and return it in a header named `Otoroshi-State-Resp`. Otoroshi is also sending a `JWT token`in a header named `Otoroshi-Claim` that the target app can validate.

### Canary mode

Otoroshi provides a feature called `Canary mode`. It lets you define new targets for a service, and route a percentage of the traffic on those targets. It's a good way to test a new version of a service before public release. As any client need to be routed to the same version of targets any time, Otoroshi will issue a special header and a cookie containing a `session id`. The header is named `Otoroshi-Canary-Id`.

### Service health check

Otoroshi is also capable of checking the health of a service. You can define a URL that will be tested, and Otoroshi will ping that URL regularly. Will doing so, Otoroshi will pass a numeric value in a header named `Otoroshi-Health-Check-Logic-Test`. You can respond with a header named `Otoroshi-Health-Check-Logic-Test-Result` that contains the value of `Otoroshi-Health-Check-Logic-Test` + 42 to indicate that the service is working properly.

### Service circuit breaker

In Otoroshi, each service has its own client settings with a circuit breaker and some retry capabilities. In the `Client settings` section, you will be able to customize the client's behavior.

### Service settings

You can also provide some additionnal information about a given service, like an `Open API` descriptor, some metadata, a list of whitelisted/blacklisted ip addresses, etc.

Here you can also define some headers that will be added to each request to the targets. And you will be able to define headers to route the call only if the defined header is present on the request.

### Custom error templates

Finally, you can define custom error templates that will be displayed when an error occurs when Otoroshi try to reach the target or when Otoroshi itself has an error. You can also define custom templates for maintenance and service pages.
